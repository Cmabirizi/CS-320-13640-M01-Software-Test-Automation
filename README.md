# CS-320-13640-M01 Software Test, Automation

## Overview  
This repository contains artifacts from my CS 320 coursework, showcasing my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The included files demonstrate my ability to create unit tests, analyze different testing approaches, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet software requirements.  

## Artifacts Included  

### Project One  
- `Contact.java` – Defines the Contact class with required attributes and constraints.  
- `ContactService.java` – Manages contacts, ensuring unique IDs and data integrity.  
- `ContactTest.java` – Unit tests for the Contact class.  
- `ContactServiceTest.java` – Unit tests for the ContactService class.  

### Project Two  
- `Summary_and_Reflections_Report.pdf` – A reflection on software testing strategies, automation benefits, and quality assurance best practices.  

## Reflection  

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?  
To ensure functionality, I use rigorous testing techniques such as unit tests, integration tests, and automated test suites. Security is addressed by following best practices like input validation, secure coding standards, and vulnerability assessments.  

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?  
I analyze user requirements through documentation and stakeholder feedback. These needs are translated into functional specifications, which guide the software design and testing process.  

### How do I approach designing software?  
I follow a structured approach that includes requirement analysis, system design, implementation, testing, and iteration. I prioritize modularity, maintainability, and scalability while ensuring the software meets user expectations.
